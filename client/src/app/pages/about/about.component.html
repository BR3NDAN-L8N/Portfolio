            Before learning web technologies at the University of New Hampshire, I spent four years leading a team
            of
            Merchandisers that was regularly ahead of schedule and able to assist other teams who had fallen behind.
            We
            achieved this by starting with larger projects in the morning and then sprinkling in smaller projects we
            could complete before the dayâ€™s end. Each project was completed in an MVP fashion allowing us to get the
            bulk of the work done quickly. Within the last hour or two of the day, we were able to revisit those
            projects if any changes were requested. This allowed us to complete projects in less time than was
            recommended. After each two-week sprint, the client had hundreds of new products to meet growing
            customer
            demand as well as a cleaner, more organized user-interface.
